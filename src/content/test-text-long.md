# Dutch Prize Papers
The Prize Papers are documents pilfered by British pirates from enemy ships in the period 1652-1815. These papers are stored in the archive of the High Court of Admiralty in The National Archives in Kew (London). Approximately a quarter of the Prize Papers originates from Dutch ships. Apart from shipâ€™s journals, loading summaries, accounts, plantation lists and interviews with crew members, this part-collection also contains approximately 38,000 business and private letters. The letters originate from all social strata of society and most of them never reached their intended^[Text of inline footnote] destination.



## Research
![my image](images/logo-inv-gemeente-museum.jpg#center) The huge variety of the Prize Papers makes it suitable for different types of research. It means that the Prize Papers can be used for a wide range of research topics, for example, for developments in language and dialect, trade, material culture, social relationships and knowledge transfer from the 17th to the 19th century. A large international research project by the universities of Oxford and Birmingham led by Jelle van Lottum focused on the migration of sailors and the distribution of human capital, based on records of interviews with crew members. This research was financed by the Economic and Social Research Council (2011-2016).

The Sailing Letters, a project carried out by the National Library of the Netherlands in 2004, introduced the Prize Papers to a broad group of Dutch researchers. Five Sailing Letters Journals  appeared were published between 2008 and 2013 to make this rich and versatile resource even more widely known.

### Perservation and digitisation
The award in 2015 of a substantial subsidy to Huygens ING by Metamorfoze, the national programme for paper heritage preservation, made it possible to preserve and digitise 144.000 pages of selected documents.

#### Subproject: VRE
In order to make material that has been digitised but not yet ordered accessible, Huygens ING will develop a Virtual Research Environment (VRE). The VRE is financed by Collaborating Maritime Funds.
